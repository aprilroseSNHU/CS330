# CS330

When designing software, I focus on breaking down the problem into manageable components, ensuring that each part of the system is well-defined and interacts smoothly with the others. For my 3D scene, this meant carefully planning the layout of objects and their interactions, such as camera controls and lighting. My approach is iterative—I start with a basic version and gradually add features, refining the design to meet the project’s goals.

Through this project, I developed stronger skills in modular programming and spatial reasoning, which allowed me to create reusable functions and maintain organized code. The experience of integrating textures, lighting, and user controls taught me the importance of making the codebase flexible and adaptable. I learned to balance creative design with technical constraints, ensuring the final product was both functional and visually appealing.

In future projects, I’ll apply the iterative and modular strategies I used here. These tactics ensure that complex tasks are manageable and that the code remains easy to maintain and extend. This approach not only streamlined the development process for this project but also provided a solid foundation for tackling more advanced software design challenges in the future.
